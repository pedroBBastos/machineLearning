quizz 2

Question 1: The graph below denotes the training and validation error curves of a
supervised system. What do these curves indicate between step k-p and k? *
	-> The curves indicate overfitting since the validation error is increasing while
	the training error is decreasing.
	
Question 2: For k cross-validation, larger k value implies more bias. *

Question 3: Feature scaling is an important step before applying K-Means algorithm.
What is reason behind this? *
	-> In distance calculation it will give the same weights for all features.

Question 4: Suppose you are training a supervised machine learning system. The
system at each iteration has a training and validation loss, as shown in the table below.
Which iteration should the algorithm stop to avoid overfitting or underfitting? *
